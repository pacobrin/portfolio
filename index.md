## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Paige Cobrin Headshot.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}
 
My name is Paige Cobrin, and I am a junior at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Business - a foundation that bridges rigorous technical training with strategic business insight. Academically, my engineering coursework has trained me to break down complex systems, apply quantitative frameworks, and design efficient solutions. My business minor has complemented this technical foundation with strategy, leadership, and management coursework, enabling me to think critically about organizational decision-making and long-term growth. This blend of technical and business perspectives has prepared me to ambitiously create innovative solutions with meaningful impact.

On Cornell DEBUT, a biomedical device project team, I contributed to the hardware design of MeyeAttention, a pupillometry-based ADHD diagnostic device recently placed first for the AI/ML category at the Medtronic/BMES Student Design Competition. This experience required technical rigor, creativity, and teamwork to bring an innovative solution from concept to prototype. I am drawn to the world of medical devices, as I have witnessed firsthand how leveraging advanced technology can save lives, addressing various problems that were thought to once be untreatable. The intersection of business and technology is an area of immense opportunity to drive impact, and I plan to do just that.
