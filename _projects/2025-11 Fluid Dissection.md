My final project for MAE 3230: Fluid Mechanics was to perform a fluid mechanical dissection on a machine. My group was assigned an inkjet printer. We worked to take apart the printer and observe the innerworkings of the mechanisms. The printer itself has mainly mechanical processes, but the ink cartridges function using the fluid mechanical systems to dispense the ink. We made a 5 minute video outlining how an inkjet printer works with relevant equations and concepts. In our group of 5 members, we each contributed to the dissection, and my main contributions were in the conceptual investigation of capillary action, as well as putting together the final video.The video is linked below.
