My final project for MAE 3260: System Dynamics was to investigate the control behavior of a common household machine. My group chose to study blenders and compare the performance of inexpensive open-loop models to high-end blenders such as the Ninja or Vitamix. We examined the mechanical and electrical components, documented how each system responds to changing load, and evaluated how closed-loop feedback improves consistency and torque control. In our group of four, we each contributed to the teardown and analysis; my main contributions were researching the motor control strategies of high-tech blenders and helping develop the final comparison between open- and closed-loop systems.
