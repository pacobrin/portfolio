MeyeAttention is a low-cost, wearable pupillometric device that uses machine learning to provide a quick, objective measure of attention dysregulation. In less than 15 minutes, MeyeAttention can deliver insights that currently require hours of specialized testing. Our mission is to make ADHD screening more accessible, equitable, and data-driven.

With a $3.8B market opportunity, MeyeAttention has the potential to save physicians over 120 million hours of testing annually while improving access for patients.

At the Medtronic/BMES Student Design Competition at the 2025 Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Conference, our team won first place in the AI/ML category. This award includes a $2,500 prize and dedicated mentorship from Medtronic engineers and scientists as we continue the commercialization process.

Over a two year period, our team created this device from ideation to actually building it. My role was hardware lead, where I was responsible for building the physical device, and integrating all of the other parts into the design seamlessly.
