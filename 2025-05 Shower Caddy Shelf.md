Over the course of my soophomore spring semester, I worked in a group of 6 to design and build a usable device to solve a need of our choosing. We created SPLASH - a shower caddy that adheres to a shower wall and expands into a shelf to improve the communal shower experience.

Our group, the H2Organizers, was selected to present at the final competition for best product at the end of the semester. We won the popular vote for first place.
